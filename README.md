This is my personal project I'm working on.

My plan is to design and implement a WebApp and maybe generate a Hybrid App with Cordova.

Technologies I plan to use:

First Steps:

1. HTML5
2. Css3
3. JavaScript
4. jQuery lib
5. PHP
6. MYSQL
7. Xampp for Development

Second Step:

1. CSS Framework like Foundation or Bootstrap
2. Maybe jQuery Mobil lib for better Event-Handling

I don't know yet if i go by hand or use something like angular for a MVC.

Any suggestions are appreciated.
